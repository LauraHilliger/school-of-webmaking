			<p>Welcome to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#teachtheweb</a>. We’re glad you’re here. If you’re new to the Mozilla Webmaker community, here is sample of what’s in store:</p>

			<h2>What’s <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#teachtheweb</a>?</h2>
			
			<p>A nifty blended learning initiative by <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, peer-powered by <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>. This course is free and open and will be repeating periodically. Read about the very first <a href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/">#teachtheweb here</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>What will I do here?</h2>
			
			<p>We’re here to help you integrate digital making and web skills into your teaching practice with collaborative, peer-to-peer methodologies. You’ll be learning the community-driven pedagogies behind Webmaker by building things yourself, sharing them with others, and starting to teach the world the web.</p>
			
			<p>Each Module will have 3 parts: you’ll explore, make and reflect--and do so in community.</p>
