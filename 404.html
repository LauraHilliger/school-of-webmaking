					<p>A 404 is a Standard Response Code meaning that although a resource was requested, the server could not locate that resource. Usually, a 404 happens when the user makes a mistake and types in an incorrect <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL" style="color:white;text-decoration:underline;">URL</a>, but it also happens when <em>we</em> provide you with an incorrect URL in a <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org" style="color:white;text-decoration:underline;">conversation</a>, email or <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/TeachTheWeb/Calls" style="color:white;text-decoration:underline;">community call</a>. It's probably our fault - sorry about that!</p>
