#What exactly is Digital Rights Management (DRM)?

DRM is shorthand for a group of technologies used to control the use of digital content after it has been sold to consumers. Perhaps the most familiar example is the copy-protection added to DVD and Blu-Ray discs. Publishers and copyright holders claim that DRM is necessary to prevent the illegal copying or altering of copyrighted material. 

In 2014, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organization for the web, accepted calls from the entertainment industry add Encrypted Media Extensions[1] (EME) to the HTML 5.1 specifications. Using this system, web browsers can use a 'Content Decryption Module' (CDM) to access restricted content. Up until this decision, publishers and copyright holders were forced to use increasingly-unpopular technologies such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight to add digital locks to their content. 

Mozilla made the controversial decision to pursue a solution that would allow users of the Firefox web browser to access DRM-enabled content via EME. However, as Chairperson Mitchell Baker said at the time, “this is not a happy day for the web.”[2] More details about this decision can be found on her blog.[3]
Reasons DRM is bad for the web

While there are some who see the inclusion of DRM in the specification for HTML 5.1 as a victory[4], there are many more opponents to it. Cory Doctorow[5] is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger well-known for his opposition to DRM. He came up with 'Doctorow's Law':
"Anytime someone puts a lock on something you own, against your wishes, and doesn't give you the key, they're not doing it for your benefit."[6]

There are at least three main reasons why DRM on the web is something to be avoided:
1. DRM does not work
2. DRM is bad for users
3. DRM is bad for artists and copyright holders
1. DRM does not work

Like any lock, DRM doesn’t stop circumvention. Just as someone unable to unlock a door could climb in through a window, so there are ways around DRM for those determined enough:

> DRM  doesn’t stop people who scan books, or retype books. DRM doesn’t stop people who download widely available cracks that can remove all the  DRM  from an entire e-book collection. And DRM doesn’t stop people who  are  inclined to download the DRM-free pirate editions. All DRM does is punish legitimate users who had the misfortune to be so honest that they  paid for the book, rather than taking it.

## DRM is bad for users
DRM technologies are, by their very nature, closed-source, meaning that people cannot inspect the source code of the software used to unlock the content they have purchased. There have been occasions, including the 2005 Sony rootkit case[8], where DRM software installed by users to  access content compromised their entire system - leaving it wide open for hackers.

## DRM is bad for artists and copyright holders
The implicit message behind DRM is that the people who hold the copyright should be able to dictate what kind of devices can access the copyright work. This stifles innovation, relying on vested interests to dictate what comes next. Innovation and creativity comes from unexpected places - think of coffee warmers that plug into USB sockets, or things that can be powered by car ‘cigarette lighter’ sockets:
 
>Today's copyright -- the thing that DRM nominally props up -- didn't come down off the mountain on two stone tablets. It was created in living memory to accommodate the technical reality created by the inventors of the previous generation. To abandon invention now robs tomorrow's artists of the new businesses and new reach and new audiences that the Internet and the PC can give them.
