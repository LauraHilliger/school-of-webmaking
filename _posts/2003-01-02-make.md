# Make to Learn: Connecting Our Community

## 1. What's a Networked Community? 

As we connect and build our Webmaker community, let's reflect on other communities on the web and what makes them work. Go ahead and hop on [Discourse](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/t/whats-a-networked-community/101) and let's build some principles together.

## 2. Find Your Crew

We <3 codesign. Every great event and online course is well-served by forming a design team to bounce ideas off of, distribute responsibilities, and help promote their efforts.

Think through which communities you'd like to serve, and post ideas for building your crew to [Discourse](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/t/finding-your-crew-forming-your-tiger-team/103).

## 3. Cordially Invite Others to Participate

- Make an invitation for the people you care about to explore the web with you. Let yourself be inspired by feedback from the playtesting round, and think about how to #TeachTheWeb in a way that speaks to your participants' interests. For inspiration, check out the [Maker Party Invitation template](https://webmaker.makes.org/thimble/maker-party-invitation).
