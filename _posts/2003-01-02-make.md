# Make to Learn: Connecting Our Community

## 1. What's a Networked Community? 

As we connect and build our crew, let's reflect on other communities on the web and what makes them work. Go ahead and hop on [Discourse](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/t/whats-a-networked-community/101) and let's build some principles together.

## 2. Cordially Invite Others to Participate

- Make an invitation for the people you care about to explore the web with you. Let yourself be inspired by feedback from the playtesting round, and think about how to #teachtheweb in a way that speaks to your participants' interests. For inspiration, check out: [https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lart/](https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lart/).

Other ideas to get your creativity moving:

- Make a popcorn video that invites the collaborators you'd like to work with to help you run a Maker Party in your local area.
- Make a popcorn video about how a Maker Party in your local area would be unique.
- Make a list of like-minded organizations and individuals in your area. Then write a post about who they and how you think you might collaborate.
– Contact like-minded organizations and individuals in your area, ask them to contribute to your event, then write a post explaining who will do what for your #MakerParty.
