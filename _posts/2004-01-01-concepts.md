#What exactly does Net Neutrality mean?

The Internet as we know it is built on two promises: anyone can make anything and those thingscan be shared with anyone, anywhere. These promises are currently at risk as policy makers consider whether to adopt rules to protect 'Net Neutrality' - or to undermine it by developing corporate 'fast lanes'. The latter would break the level playing field that makes the open Internet so innovative and resilient. 

‘Net Neutrality’ describes an Internet that treats content providers, users, and information equally. That is to say, if you subscribe to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you can send and receive information of your choosing using your internet connection. Your neighbor can send and receive information from her home in the same way. However, the connection itself is only *part* of the story.

When you pay for a certain speed for your internet access service, one way of thinking about it is that you are purchasing a bigger 'pipe'. When you do this, is it reasponable to expect to use this bigger pipe for all your data, no matter where it comes from. You do not expect data from one website or service to be treated different to that from other websites or services. 

#What Can Happen If We Lose Net Neutrality?

</div>

If we lose Net Neutrality, we let ISPs decide what to do with the data and speed we have paid to access. For example, our ISPs could decide to slow down YouTube to the point where we can't watch videos, unless Google pays for a corporate 'fast lane'. The ISP could say, "You're welcome to use ISPTube, our video service, at the full speed you're paying for!" If we lose Net Neutrality, your ISP - who provide to everything you access on the internet, can now pick and choose which data to prioritise.

Net Neutrality is important because, without it, the ISPs that deliver data to our homes and businesses have the power to decide which to deliver quickly and which to slow down. They are likely to do this based either on the profit they can make from doing so, or pressure from governments. An example of this in the UK are ISPs who block access to certain websites and limit traffic coming via the bittorrent protocol. 

##Important Terms

###Information Services vs. Telecommunications Services. 

In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission makes a distinction between 'Telecommunications Carriers' and 'Internet Service Providers'. ISPs remain exempt from common carrier rules such as neutrality. Cable broadband, DSL and wireless are defined as 'Information Services', freeing it from federal regulations and important consumer protections. 

Vi Hart Explains it well here:

If ISPs were treated as common carriers they would be subject to a better set of rules governing companies entrusted with the maintenance and delivery of public goods.

<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2014/06/16/tell-the-u-s-congress-to-protect-net-neutrality/">Mozilla supports Net Neutrality</a> and has launched <a href="https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/s/protect-net-neutrality">a petition</a> to pressure the FCC to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/files/2014/05/Mozilla-Petition.pdf">treat ISPs as common carriers</a> to prevent ISPs from interfering in what we choose to build from the open Web.

#Losing Net Neutrality is bad for the Web

Net Neutrality helps ensure an Open Web and open societies that protect diversity, democracy, and equality. An Open Web helps ensure both communication and privacy - action and safety. The loss of Net Neutrality harms the Internet and its users in at least three significant ways.


## 1. Losing Net Neutrality hurts access to the Web

Throughout the United States- as well as throughout the world - many people live with limited or no access to the Internet. If we lose Net Neutrality, it will be even more difficult than it is now to get those communities online without severely compromising their experience with the Internet. 

If ISPs can charge companies and consumers to block or 'throttle down' certain content, we could find ourselves in a world where <a href="https://keyboardkat.makes.org/thimble/LTIxMDA3NTY0ODA=/lofi-nofi-teaching-kit">low-fi and no-fi communities</a> have to accept deals that limit their communications and the scope of the content and services they can get online. We could find ourselves in a world where people with the least access to the Net have to trade digital compliance for corporate sponsorship of a strictly capitalist version of the Web. 

Spreading access through such corporate whim undermines the fabric of the Open Web and makes the Internet a privately held privilege rather than a public good. Essentially, if people in positions of privilege give up Net Neutrality and agree to participate in corporate curation of the Internet, then those people will wind up subsidizing the impoverishment of the Internet in communities struggling to get online.

## 2. Losing Net Neutrality hurts innovation

It's bad enough that alliances of increasingly monopolistic 'information' companies control fiber networks in the United States. Imagine if those companies could squelch new online content and service providers as easily as they prevent new ISPs from laying fiber of their own. Do we like all the services we use now, or would we rather they improve or go away? Do we look forward to an increasing diversity of content and services online - a diversity of experiences that goes beyond what we can do and imagine today? If so, we need Net Neutrality. Without it, we'll to have to settle for more of what we have now. 

The companies with the deepest pockets today will be able to pay ISPs the most for preferential treatment in the future. We, the users, won't have the resources to compete with those companies. Imagine exponentially increased Kickstarter budgets that have to take into account 'delivery fees' for all the 'different' ISPs in the US alone. Imagine a Mozilla that has to pay just to be on a closed Web in order to promote an Open one.

## 3. Losing Net Neutrality hurts free expression

The Internet brings us together. It lets us stay connected with family, friends, and coworkers near and far. It lets us experience thing we could never otherwise experience, and it lets us draw courage, inspiration, and solace from one another in those bright times of universal hope and in those dark times we hope never to experience again. It's not difficult to imagine a future in which we have to pay more to break out of a cheery, consumerist firewall just to find others who are as opposed to oppression as we are. It's not difficult to imagine a future in which the world is always appropriately happy and scary if we take the Internet at face value. 

We need Net Neutrality and an Open Web to share the truth of our experiences and the truth of what's happening in the world with one another. If we give up on Net Neutrality we give up, in some large part, our voice and our ability to listen to others. The true wealth of the Internet is in us and the work we do together through the Web to enrich our communities with dignity, equality, and humanity; the true wealth of the Internet is not in money.

Now that you know what net neutrality is and why defending it is important, it's time to make your voice heard. We need public policy that protects the Internet by ensuring:

1. No blocking
2. Nondiscrimination
3. No Paid Prioritization
4. Applicable to mobile and fixed services equally
