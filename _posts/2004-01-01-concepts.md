#What exactly does Net Neutrality mean?

The Internet as we know it is built on two promises: anyone can make anything and you can share with anyone. These promises are at risk as policy makers consider whether to adopt rules to protect 'Net Neutrality' or to undermine it. If the latter happens, we will lose the greatest global and shared resource for expression and innovation.

‘Net Neutrality’ describes an Internet that treats content providers, users, and information equally. That is to say, if you subscribe to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) in your local area, you be able to send and receive all sorts of information from your computer in the same way your neighbor sends and receives information from her home. But that's only part of the deal.

When you pay for a certain speed for your Internet access service, you expect to be able to use it for all your data, and you expect to have free choice of the data and communications you use on your Internet access service.<a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3231/5865671302_f12d68c1b5_n.jpg"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3231/5865671302_f12d68c1b5_n.jpg"></a>

If we lose Net Neutrality, we lose that choice. Instead, we let ISPs decide what to do with that data and speed.

For example, if we lose Net Neutrality, our ISPs could decide to slow down YouTube to the point where we can't watch videos, unless Google pays it a bribe. Then they'll say "You can always watch ISPTube, our video service, at the speed you're paying for!" Your Internet access service, which you used to be able to use for anything on the Internet, is now at their discretion to pick and choose.

Without Net Neutrality, the ISPs that deliver content to our homes and businesses have the power to decide on a hyper-monetized, case-by-case, consumer-by-consumer basis what it is we're allowed to 'pull' and 'push' on the Internet. Because current law views ISPs as 'information' companies rather than 'telecommunications' companies, they are not bound to noninterference in our digital lives. 'Common carriers' that facilitate public goods like our telephone network can be prevented from charging us more to call, say, our grandma (who lives a few blocks over) than to call for pizza, but without Net Neutrality, ISPs could simply block our emails to grandma if she doesn't pay for a family email plan and instead deliver her coupons from a pizza company that paid the ISP to do so unless grandma also pays to block unsolicited ads from her email.

And BitTorrent suggests what could happen without Net Neutrality <a href="http://jointhefastlane.com/#packages">here</a>:<a href="http://jointhefastlane.com"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QWA3Esh.png" height="400px" width="300px"></a>

If ISPs were treated as common carriers, and if they didn't have the power to decide what to deliver to us at whatever speeds they want, then they would have to face a better set of rules governing companies entrusted with the maintenance e and delivery of public goods.

Without Net Neutrality, those ISPs make the rules (often in cooperation with one another as they do not compete for territory) and can then charge us not to change them too terribly often, we hope.

<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2014/06/16/tell-the-u-s-congress-to-protect-net-neutrality/">Mozilla supports Net Neutrality</a> and has launched <a href="https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/s/protect-net-neutrality">a petition</a> to pressure the FCC to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/files/2014/05/Mozilla-Petition.pdf">treat ISPs as common carriers</a> to prevent ISPs from interfering in what we choose to build from the open Web.

#Reasons losing Net Neutrality is bad for the Web
    
Net Neutrality helps ensure an Open Web and open societies that protect diversity, democracy, and equality. An Open Web helps ensure both communication and privacy - action and safety. The loss of Net Neutrality harms the Internet and its users in at least three significant ways.

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Losing Net Neutrality hurts the spread of the Open Web to low-fi and no-fi communities.</strong> Throughout the United States- as well as throughout the world - many people live with limited or no access to the Internet. If we lose Net Neutrality, it will be even more difficult than it is now to get those communities online without severely compromising their experience with the Internet. If ISPs can charge companies and consumers to block or 'throttle down' certain content, we could find ourselves in a world where low-fi and no-fi communities have to accept deals that limit their communications and the scope of the content and services they can get online. We could find ourselves in a world where people with the least access to the Net have to trade digital compliance for corporate sponsorship of a strictly capitalist version of the Web. Spreading access through such corporate whim undermines the fabric of the Open Web and makes the Internet a privately held privilege rather than a public good. Essentially, if people in positions of privilege give up Net Neutrality and agree to participate in corporate curation of the Internet, then those people will wind up subsidizing the impoverishment of the Internet in communities struggling to get online.</li>

        <li><strong>Losing Net Neutrality hurts the kinds of competition that drive innovation.</strong> It's bad enough that alliances of increasingly monopolistic 'information' companies control fiber networks in the United States. Imagine if those companies could squelch new online content and service providers as easily as they prevent new ISPs from laying fiber of their own. Do we like all the services we use now, or would we rather they improve or go away? Do we look forward to an increasing diversity of content and services online - a diversity of experiences that goes beyond what we can do and imagine today? If so, we need Net Neutrality. Without it, we'll to have to settle for what we have now. For more of the same. The companies with the deepest pockets today will be able to pay ISPs the most for preferential treatment in the future. We, the users, won't have the resources to compete with those companies. Imagine exponentially increased Kickstarter budgets that have to take into account 'delivery fees' for all the 'different' ISPs in the US alone. Imagine a Mozilla that has to pay just to be on a closed Web in order to promote an Open one.</li>

        <li><strong>Losing Net Neutrality hurts us.</strong> The Internet brings us together. It lets us stay connected with family, friends, and coworkers near and far. It lets us experience thing we could never otherwise experience, and it lets us draw courage, inspiration, and solace from one another in those bright times of universal hope and in those dark times we hope never to experience again. It's not difficult to imagine a future in which we have to pay more to break out of a cheery, consumerist firewall just to find others who are as opposed to oppression as we are. It's not difficult to imagine a future in which the world is always appropriately happy and scary if we take the Internet at face value. We need Net Neutrality and an Open Web to share the truth of our experiences and the truth of what's happening in the world with one another. If we give up on Net Neutrality we give up, in some large part, our voice and our ability to listen to others. The true wealth of the Internet is in us and the work we do together through the Web to enrich our communities with dignity, equality, and humanity; the true wealth of the Internet is not in money.</li>
