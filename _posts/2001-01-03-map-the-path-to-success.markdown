The Open Web is the most important infrastructure and ecosystem that supports connected learning and making in the digital space.

![a Mark Surman doodle][7]

When we talk about “openness”, there are a variety of things that come to mind. We can view openness i) through the lens of copyright/copyleft, ii) through the technical structures that make a webpage open or not, iii) through the cultural practices the Open Community prides itself on, and so on.  The term openness is a confluence of technical, cultural and social definitions that can get meta pretty quickly.

Nevertheless, there are several tenets of openness that apply to the technical implementation as well as the social and cultural usage of the Web:

 - The first is **decentralization**. The Open Web is made up of
   thousands and thousands of independent servers and webpages. The
   networked computers that make up the Internet are not owned by any
   single entity. Additionally, webpages are created and maintained by
   millions of people. **Decentralization in the social and cultural space
   is inherent in the Open Web.** 

 - Another tenet is **transparency**. You can
   see how any webpage is built, you can copy a webpages code and
   duplicate and/or remix it to be your own by viewing its source code.
   Furthermore, the culture of Open is one that transparent about
   processes, creations and authors. We make media and write posts about
   our work. We ask questions and allow anyone to feedback on them
   through commenting and social media. We change things based on what
   our peers say, and we explain our decisions openly, so that everyone
   can see not only what we've done, but how and why. We iterate on our
   ideas based on the feedback we receive from our peers. 
 
 - With decentralization and transparency comes the tenet of **hackability**. The
   Open Web is a structure that makes remix and redistribution easy, and
   the culture that lives by these tenets takes pride in extending,
   changing and reforming each other's work. **Because we can see how
   things are built, we can change them and apply new meaning and
   context atop someone else's ideas.** We start to have a conversation
   through production, and that is something that is supported by and
   encouraged through the Open Web and Open Culture.

Mozilla is a global community of people who work openly. To learn more about what exactly that means, check out [this great list of resources][8].
