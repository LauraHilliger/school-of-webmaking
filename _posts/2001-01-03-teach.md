# Building for Participatory Learning Teaching Kit

We've developed <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/building-for-participatory-learning-teaching-kit">a Teaching Kit</a> that will help you codesign and build resources with your local community. Get a group of interested people together and run a maker party where you can all learn and make open educational resources together!

We'd love to hear how you feel about this Teaching Kit, so please [share](http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker) how your event went!
