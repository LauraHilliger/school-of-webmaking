# Advocating for Net Neutrality: Make Your Voice Heard

### 1. Get Creative: Remix the Net Neutrality Teaching Kit
Make an open educational resource designed to teach something about Net Neutrality to someone you care about. Remix the <a href="https://keyboardkat.makes.org/thimble/LTQzNjIwNzM2MA==/net-neutrality-teaching-kit">Net Neutrality Teaching Kit</a>, associated activities, or <a href="http://webmaker.org/tools">start from scratch</a>. 

Need help with the Webmaker tools? <a href="../../exploring/resources/">Check out the resources under Exploring</a>.

Try finding someone to collaborate with, and make something epic. Great activities made during this training have a chance to be added to the Net Neutrality Teaching Kit!

### 2. Run a Net Neutrality #MakerParty
- Contact local <a href="http://mozillians.org">Mozillians</a>, like-minded organizations and/or individuals in your area, ask them to collaborate on a #NetNeutrality <a href="http://party.webmaker.org">#MakerParty</a>. Remix the Net Neutrality teaching kit for your event agenda, and add your #NetNeutrality event(s) to the [Community Map!] (https://events.webmaker.org?ref=training)


### 3. Sign a petition and argue its relevance
Petitions and emails are a great way to apply pressure to policy makers. Tell them to do the right thing to protect net neutrality.

* Decide whether to sign <a href="https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/s/protect-net-neutrality">Mozilla's petition</a> and if so, explain your personal reasons for why or why not in the <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/net-neutrality">course discussion</a>. 

### 4. File your very first FCC complaint!
The more the FCC hears directly from people, the better it will be to protect the Web. You can file your comments either online or via mail. When you comment, don't forget to tell the FCC why Net Neutrality is important to you.

* You can use the EFF's <a href="https://www.dearfcc.org/">"Dear FCC" template</a> or <a href="http://consumerist.com/2014/05/15/how-to-tell-the-fcc-exactly-what-you-think-about-the-proposed-net-neutrality-rule/">the Consumerist guide</a> to file FCC complaint. You can see *all* <a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment_search/execute?proceeding=14-28">filed complaints</a> on this issue. 
* Freeform your complaint at <a href="http://fcc.gov/comments">http://FCC.gov/comments</a> or email openinternet@fcc.gov
* If you prefer to submit via mail or in person, you can mail your comments to: 
	
	FCC Secretary Marlene H. Dortch  
	445 12th Street, SW Room  TW-B204  
	Washington, DC 20554  
	

	Or, you can hand deliver them to 
	
	236  Massachusetts  Ave., NE  
	Suite 110  
	Washington, DC 20002 

	between 8 a.m.  and 7 p.m. ET. But don't bring anything in an envelope or box, or they won't take it!

* Once you've submitted, share your complaint in the <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/net-neutrality">course discussion</a>. 

### 5. Write a Letter to the Editor of your local newspaper
Congress goes on summer recess, meaning they return to their home districts. They'll presumably be reading their local newspaper. Let's make sure they know how their voters feel about Net Neutrality. Collaborate with one of your peers in Webmaker Training to remix this sample letter:

>We're  a team of X people who just participated in a Net Neutrality training. We learned a lot about NN, including things I didn't know, like 

>* X 
>* Y

>We're writing because hundreds of Net Neutrality workshops like this are happening all over America this summer, because it's important people  understand this issue that impacts all of us. We want local and national leaders to protect Net Neutrality because *X, Y, and Z*. I hope my  friends and neighbors in *XX town* learn about Net Neutrality and do something to protect it, too.
