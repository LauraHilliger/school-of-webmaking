# Facilitating Participatory Learning Teaching Kit

We've developed <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/facilitating-participatory-learning-teaching-kit">a Teaching Kit</a> that will guide you in running a participatory event that helps others run participatory events! Get a group of interested people together and run this train the trainer event where you can all learn and practice open and participatory learning together!
