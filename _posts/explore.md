#Building on the Web

The Way We Build *Matters*
------------------------

This week, we'll start a conversation around three of the practices we use in the open community to create learning resources that help you empower and inform learners. Our aim is to continue strengthening this community, sharing experiences and make some hackable, shareable resources that push the boundaries of participatory, collaborative, learner-centric learning. You can use the included links to go deeper into each of these topics.

When we think of the Web, we tend to think of it as a technical infrastructure and a series of services that allow us to connect with one another and share digital artifacts. Many of us don't often consider the immensity of the true fact of what the Web is:

**The Web is human knowledge documented.**

A very, very large amount of human knowledge. It's not new for human beings to document what we know. We've been doing it since the invention of [tokens at the origin of writing][7]. What is new is the way we need to interact with people and systems to make use of that knowledge. What's new are the types of skills and competencies we need to be able to understand information and each other through these machines. **We have to have certain skills to make sense of it all.**

With the [Web Literacy Map][8], we're trying to find an easy way for educators and technologists to understand these new types of learning objectives. **What are the skills, competencies and literacies necessary to read, write and participate on the Web - now and in the future?**

*We need a way to ensure we're teaching the right things. That means exploring ways to help learners discover pathways, and of course, to find ways for us all to track our impact. That's where the map comes in - we can build consensus around the overall learning objectives and then each chart our course against it.*

As we explore new ways to educate people and try to draw lines to each learners interest, working in skills and topics that lead a learner to becoming truly educated is kind of the point.

It's important to remember that many people are working within systems that make us feel like hacking is not allowed or impossible. Many of us feel that we have to adhere to this or that policy. The question is: Is it our own misconception that makes us feel that way? Does the policy really spell out the way that we are allowed to teach? And even if it does, how can we walk the line?

[In this excellent article][9], [Bud Hunt][10] talks about the agency that we have in teaching and learning. When we're thinking about adding digital and web literacies into our practice, we should remember that we are in control of our own experiences.

**There are several specific issues** that affect our ability to bring webmaking into both formal and informal learning spaces.

For one, there are **definite hardware and network issues**. Some of our learning institutions lack the technical infrastructure to supply learning programs with the high speed internet that is becoming invaluable to webmaking. Others have **strong filters** and monitoring systems that make it hard to allow interest-driven projects. There are marginalized communities with **little or no access to hardware**.

As we think about how we might best [#teachtheweb][12], we should make commitments not only to the mashing up of hard and soft skills, but also to the proliferation of access in our communities. Until there is equal access, we need to find ways to teach [web literacy skills][13] no matter the technical infrastructure we're tied to.

We can (and should) help people understand the basics of **cyber security**. Even simple settings can greatly decrease the risk of an attack and protect you and your data. We can empower our learners by **helping them create secure passwords, know when a website is secure and turn on firewalls and proxies.**

Finally, we need to be aware of how our online movements are documented, how our data is being used, and what we can do to protect ourselves. [Lightbeam][15], an easy-to-use tool that can help us understand tracking, explains that:

*“Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience. But most tracking happens without users' consent and without their knowledge. That’s not okay. It should be you who decides when, how and if you want to be tracked.”* http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/

The Role of the Educator
------------------------

A while back, someone proposed that as digital learning rises, [we won't need teachers anymore][16] (this isn't the first time someone has said this). This is completely ridiculous of course, but brings up some interesting thoughts on our roles as educators.

Just as the influx of digital technologies has begun to redefine what it means to be educated, so too has this influx redefined what it means to be an educator. Today, **learning happens everywhere, and there are teachers everywhere.** Some of them identify as “educators” or “teachers”, while others identify as “technologists” or “instructors”. Some of them have regular classes while others are known around the office as someone who “can fix your computer”. **What all of these people have in common is that they are mentoring learners.** They might be doing it in different ways – some of them mentor professionally, others aren't even aware of their impact – but technology is pervasive enough that anyone with the applicable skills is trying to pull others along.

As we advance our practice and try to find ways to navigate the waters around technology or around pedagogy, we need to consistently turn our focus inward. **We need to remember those learning experiences that most touched us.** Whether the digital space was involved at all isn't relevant, it's how we interacted with people around us. **What kind of freedoms did we have to play and make mistakes and inspire our peers?** How were we given constraints to guide us towards learning something specific?

In Webmaking, we need to intermingle participation, collaboration and other “soft” skills with technical “hard” skills whenever we can. **Web literacy is not just about coding, and webmaking is not just about digital storytelling.** Through interest-driven “make” projects that offer the learner a safe space to explore, we can motivate and inspire our learners to be responsible citizens in both the digital and physical world.

Peers Working in the Open
------------------------

## Constructive Criticism

We gather strength and confidence from positive feedback, just as negative feedback forces us to consider whether our ideas are valid. Reaction pushes us to think about our actions, so when we work openly, we invite reaction. While metaphorical pats on the back are necessary (and encouraged!), the type of feedback that really push us to grow are thoughtfully-formulated constructive criticisms.

*Giving constructive criticism (and receiving it) is something that takes practice.* We adhere to [“if you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumper_%28Bambi%29) because we don't believe that our opinions are necessary. We forget that criticism doesn't have to lead to complete redesign or reformulation. *We also tend to spend time focusing on our own things, rather than looking at other people's ideas and thinking about making them better. We ask for feedback and expect to get some, but we rarely give our feedback freely – we wait until our specific feedback is requested or until the work directly affects our own.*

We all know how fantastic it is to get good, constructive feedback on something we're working on. What if we all took more time to give feedback like that to others? What would happen? On the flip side of giving feedback, we have to receive it. *It can be hard to hear critiques that reshape your work, but think about the input with some distance and consider how it might improve what you're doing.* If, in the end, you disagree with the critique, explain why and your reaction will lead to a further conversation. We should aim to assume good faith when discussing feedback, and think not only of what to critique, but also concrete proposals to make it better.
*Feedback is a way to invite people into your project. Asking for it can become a gateway to deeper participation and collaboration as it gives agency.*

## Deeper Collaboration

Giving feedback is an important part of collaboration, but there's more to collaboration than just giving and receiving feedback. *People learn to collaborate in different ways, along multiple paths, just as they learn to code or make things.* Our experiences in group work past and present have great influence over how we think about ourselves as collaborators, and how we act as collaborators is greatly contingent on who we are.

As we discussed last week, our roles as mentors are changing, and so are the roles of learners and peers. *These roles are fluid in maker and remix pedagogies, and they're fluid in spaces where community and inquiry drive co-learning and making.* As we discussed in “Add the Web to Anything”, we have agency to control our own experiences, which means we can experiment with our own perception of the role we're playing and even change that role. If one of us has this agency, so do all of us, which means that we have to be respectful of the differences in our collaborative styles.
We can help one another better understand fair use, remix, and transformative use by unpacking systemic and personal biases against collaboration. At the same time, we can help each other understand the pathways that lead to those biases, all the while using them to create opportunities for individual contributions that push our collaborative projects to new levels.

*In short, deeper, more meaningful collaborations will come from our ability to create complex social spaces that encourage freedom of expression and honesty.*
