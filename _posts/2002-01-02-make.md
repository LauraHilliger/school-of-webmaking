# Playtest your work

* Try out your activities from last week on the people attending #teachtheweb IRL, then create a make (or several makes) that reflects on that experience. What went right? What went wrong? Did your learners learn something? What would you change? Were all of your learning goals addressed? Were there other skills/competencies your learner acquired that you hadnâ€™t thought of? Etc! Share your playtest and reflection with the #teachtheweb community.
* Invite others who playested with you to document their feedback and include it in your reflection.

Other suggested makes:
* Start an exquisite corpse make and iterate on it collaboratively
* Send 5 people feedback and create a Storify or other artifact (HTML pad, etherpad, blogpost, etc) of your QA process.
* Make a Storify or other artifact of your revision processes this week as feedback rolls in to you.
