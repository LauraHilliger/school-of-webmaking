#Make to learn tech skills and concepts.

## Playtest your Teaching Kit

If you participated in the [Building module](http://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/building/concepts/) of #TeachTheWeb, now is the perfect time to playtest the learning resources you made. (If you haven't yet done the Building module, try the DIY Learning Experience make below!)

Gather a few of your friends, family members or learners, and run your activities with them. What went right? What went wrong? Did your learners learn something? What would you change? Were all of your learning goals addressed? Were there other skills/competencies your learner acquired that you hadnâ€™t thought of? What surprised you about your plan? Share your playtest and reflection with the [community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/facilitating). Invite others who playested to document their feedback and include it in your reflection.

## Give Feedback and Talk to Strangers
Jump into the [community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/facilitating) and start reviewing and commenting on other people's work. Being open and sharing your thoughts is a great way to train up for facilitating learning. 

Another great way to test your facilitating skills is to talk to strangers about the web... 

## DIY Learning Experience

Plan and create a lesson plan that embeds web competencies and skills with the learning goals you're most interested in teaching. Start by using [Paper Prototyping] (https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/paper/TeachingKitDesignCanvas.pdf) to organize your thoughts, then try remixing our [Teaching Kit Template](https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/10274/remix) to help frame your lesson. Think about what activities you would run. You can search webmaker.org for activities to try or make new activities with the help of the [Activity Template] (https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/10286/remix).

Share your Teaching Kit with the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/building), and personally ask 2-3 people to review it for constructive feedback.

Other suggested makes:

* Start an exquisite corpse make and iterate on it collaboratively
* Send 5 people feedback and create a Storify or other artifact (HTML pad, etherpad, blogpost, etc) of your QA process.
* Make a Storify or other artifact of your revision processes this week as feedback rolls in to you.
