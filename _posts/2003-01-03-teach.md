# Connecting Local to Global Networks Teaching Kit

We've developed <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/exploring-making-connected-learning-teaching-kit">a Teaching Kit</a> that will help you see the pedagogies of Making as Learning and Connected Learning in action. Get a group of interested people together and run a workshop where you can all learn and practice open and participatory learning together!
