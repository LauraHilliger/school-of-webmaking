## 1. DIY Learning Experience

* Make a hackable overview of the learning goals and web literacy skills you're most interested in teaching. We recommend remixing our [Teaching Kit Template](https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/10274/remix) to help frame your lesson.

* What sort of projects could folks make to show they've met those goals? Find examples and include them in your Kit.
* Share your Teaching Kit with the <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/courses/building">Discourse community</a>, and personally ask 2-3 peoeple to review it for constructive feedback.

## 2. Passion + Web + You = Learning

* What are you personally passionate about? Is it existentialist philosophy, the cosmos, privacy, baking scones?
* How would you explain the basics of your passion, and get a learner excited to explore more?
* Take a look at the [Create Your Own Comic](https://webmaker.makes.org/thimble/create-your-own-comic-a-starter-make) make in the Webmaker Community. [Remix the comic](https://webmaker.makes.org/thimble/create-your-own-comic-a-starter-make) to explain the basics of your passion.

* Or, use the [Mighty Jupiter](https://chadsansing.makes.org/thimble/webmaker-planet) template to share basic facts about your area of expertise.

* Share your make with the <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/courses/building">Discourse community</a> and jot down a few other ideas about how you can add webmaking as an assignment. 

## 3. Observe a Community of Learners (and hack it!)

Go out into the wild of the Web and find an online community, or focus on an online community that you are part of. A few general ideas:

* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/)
* [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)

When you're looking at the community, examine how the community gives and receives feedback. 

* What are the "gestures"? (e.g. Favorites, shares, upvotes, contributions)
* Who in the community benefits from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. Experts? Extroverts?)
* Who in the community does *not* benefit from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. New people, learners who speak a language other than English).
* *How would you change that system to produce more constructive feedback? Paper prototype your idea for a feedback feature and share it in the Google+ Community.*


## 4. Create a Culture of Peer Feedback with Badges
Badges are a way to build a learning community on the Web, and prompt peers to give constructive feedback to one another. Now that you've explored the [Web Literacy Map](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap), create a Badge for one of the literacies on the Map.

* Visit P2PU's [badges.p2pu.org](http://badges.p2pu.org/).
* Create a Badge for a literacy that you feel comfortable with.
* Share your Badge on Twitter and Google+ with the #teachtheweb tag.
* As other #teachtheweb folks make their Badges, apply for a Badge.
* Share your experience about peer feedback.
