1. Brainstorm adding the Web
Make a hackable overview of the learning goals and web literacy skills you're most interested in teaching. Try to think about the people you want to teach and their interests, then hack this Hackable template to make a resource that your peers can feedback on.
Make a mindmap or use another brainstorming technique to generate a lesson plan that uses physical materials, like paper-prototyping or physical remix, together with webmaking.
Make a Mentor Mob playlist that will help another mentor run an activity in their own environment or teach a particular topic.
Hack an open educational resource to include web skills. Show the iterations you went through (i.e. show us version 1, version 2 and so on.)
Make a list of crafty materials a mentor could use for physical webmaking lessons, and explain what they might be used for.
Tell your peers how you've hacked a curriculum/textbook/support manual to meet your needs. What are ways that you've exercised agency within a seemingly restricted lock-step system?

2. Exploring Webmaking as Learning

Use your learning goals from last week as the basis for an activity or resource. Use this hackable activity template to write it up so that other mentors can #teachtheweb with your material. Share it in the G+ community and on Twitter!
Other suggested makes:
Make a Mentor Mob playlist of your favorite in-person activities and share the link on G+ or Twitter.
Make a Mentor Mob playlist of your favorite online activities and share the link on G+ or Twitter.
Make a Mentor Mob playlist of a lesson centered on Webmaking and share the link on G+ or Twitter.
Make a Mentor Mob playlist for learning the basics of accessibility, security, privacy or more advanced variants and share the link on G+ or Twitter.
Make a list of informal and formal webmaker learning examples.
Make a remix of an activity and unpack the learning objectives into the Hackable Learning Goals template.
Record a hangout about webmaking as learning with other #teachtheweb participants or some colleagues. Share it or make something more from it.
Make a total remix and hack a webpage that teaches one thing (e.g. coding) into a webpage that teaches something completely different (e.g. cooking)
Use HTMLPad, JS Fiddle or NudgePad to collaboratively plan and code an activity for webmaking. Share your page!

3. Get Involved in someone elseâ€™s work
Use remix as a form of constructive criticism. Try running someone's activity from last week or do a critical review of their resource, learning goals, idea, etc. Then, remix the activity/resource to ask questions, give ideas or otherwise give your peer some feedback.
Other suggested makes:
Make a MentorMob playlist that alternates between group work and individual work.
Make a single-page project or web app with a feedback form.
Collaborate to rapidly prototype and playtest a game. Document and share everything.
Make a feedback-giving .gif animation, then remix it into a #teachtheweb project about giving good feedback.
Revise something from the past that has actionable feedback pending and document and share the revisions.
Make a "choose your own" CSS webpage adventure, ask folks to document and share the choices they make in viewing and learning from your content, and revise and publish a draft using the data you collect about users' choices.
    Share a paper prototype by creating . For example, check out Jeannie Crowley's camera hack to allow people to see the product and not the face. (help people see how easy it is to rearrange a workspace to allow us to show our work instead of talking about our work). Could be great for paper protoype sharing https://plus.google.com/u/1/photos/113905697837976594807/albums/5844535296173292417/5844535294732130194
