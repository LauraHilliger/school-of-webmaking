## 1. DIY Learning Experience

* Prototyping on paper is a good way to organize your thoughts, try this [Paper Prototyping Template] (https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/paper/TeachingKitDesignCanvas.pdf)!

* Make a hackable overview of the learning goals and web literacy skills you're most interested in teaching. We recommend remixing our [Teaching Kit Template](https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/46605/remix) to help frame your lesson.

* What activities will you run? You can search webmaker.org for activities to try or [make new activities] (https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/47075/remix).

* What sort of resources could folks make to show they've met those goals? [Find (or make!) examples](http://webmaker.org/starter-makes) and include them in your Kit.
* Share your Teaching Kit with the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/building), and personally ask 2-3 people to review it for constructive feedback.

## 2. Passion + Web + You = Learning

* What are you personally passionate about? Is it existentialist philosophy, the cosmos, privacy, baking scones?
* How would you explain the basics of your passion, and get a learner excited to explore more?

Take a look at the [Create Your Own Comic](https://webmaker.makes.org/thimble/create-your-own-comic-a-starter-make) make. [Remix the comic](https://webmaker.makes.org/thimble/create-your-own-comic-a-starter-make) to explain the basics of your passion.

Or, use the [Mighty Jupiter](https://chadsansing.makes.org/thimble/webmaker-planet) template to share basic facts about your area of expertise.

* Find more examples to remix on [Webmaker](http://webmaker.org)
* Share your make with the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/building) and jot down a few other ideas about how you can add webmaking as an assignment. 

## 3. Observe a Community of Learners (and hack it!)

Go out into the wild of the Web and find an online community, or focus on an online community that you are part of. A few general ideas:

* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/)
* [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)

When you're looking at the community, examine how the community gives and receives feedback. 

* What are the "gestures"? (e.g. Favorites, shares, upvotes, contributions)
* Who in the community benefits from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. Experts? Extroverts?)
* Who in the community does *not* benefit from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. New people, learners who speak a language other than English).
* How would you change that system to produce more constructive feedback? Paper prototype your idea for a feedback feature and share it in the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/building).

## Make & Curate to Reflect
* Which resources did you consult for your make? Wikipedia pages? Stack Overflow documentation? Flickr?
* Collect your resources and make a [Storify](https://storify.com/) or a [Pinterest board](http://www.pinterest.com/) with your relevant quotes, pictures, documents.
* Share your curated resource with the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/building) and ask people to contribute further resources on your idea.
