## 1. Brainstorm adding the Web

* Make a hackable overview of the learning goals and web literacy skills you're most interested in teaching. Try to think about the people you want to teach and their interests, then hack this Hackable template to make a resource that your peers can feedback on.
* Make a mindmap or use another brainstorming technique to generate a lesson plan that uses physical materials, like paper-prototyping or physical remix, together with webmaking.
* Make a Mentor Mob playlist that will help another mentor run an activity in their own environment or teach a particular topic.
* Hack an open educational resource to include web skills. Show the iterations you went through (i.e. show us version 1, version 2 and so on.)
* Make a list of crafty materials a mentor could use for physical webmaking lessons, and explain what they might be used for.
* Tell your peers how you've hacked a curriculum/textbook/support manual to meet your needs. What are ways that you've exercised agency within a seemingly restricted lock-step system?

## 2. Networks of Feedback on the Web

Go out into the wild of the Web and find an online community, or focus on an online community that you are part of. A few general ideas:

* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/)
* [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)

When you're looking at the community, examine how the community gives and receives feedback. 

* What are the "gestures"? (e.g. Favorites, shares, upvotes, contributions)
* Who in the community benefits from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. Experts? Extroverts?)
* Who in the community does *not* benefit from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. New people, learners who speak a language other than English).
* *How would you change that system to produce more constructive feedback? Paper prototype your idea for a feedback feature and share it in the Google+ Community.*


## 3. Create a Culture of Peer Feedback with Badges
Badges are a way to build a learning community on the Web, and prompt peers to give constructive feedback to one another. Now that you've explored the [Web Literacy Map](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap), create a Badge for one of the literacies on the Map.

* Visit P2PU's [badges.p2pu.org](http://badges.p2pu.org/).
* Create a Badge for a literacy that you feel comfortable with.
* Share your Badge on Twitter and Google+ with the #teachtheweb tag.
* As other #teachtheweb folks make their Badges, apply for a Badge.
* Share your experience about peer feedback.
