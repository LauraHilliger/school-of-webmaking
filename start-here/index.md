# What's this all about?

Spreading digital skills and openness doesn't have to be difficult, but it can be intimidating if you are new to open online communities. Mozilla is committed to helping you learn about openness while leveling up your own professional practice.

Everything here is 100% free, open and powered by a community of educators and mentors. If you get stuck or need help, please reach out to us using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#teachtheweb</a> on Twitter or in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205/stream/4723a453-f65d-49c4-a44e-cae2b9dbada1">Webmaker G+ Community</a>.

# We want to help you:
* connect with other mentors and educators (especially those in your local area) to share knowledge and resources.</li>
* use open, participatory practices to teach web skills and bring creativity and digital literacy into your practice.</li>
* plug into a global movement that believes in openness, sharing and peer to peer learning.</li>
